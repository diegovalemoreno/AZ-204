1. [Choose a messaging model in Azure to loosely connect your services](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/choose-a-messaging-model-in-azure-to-connect-your-services/)
    
    **What is a Message?**<br/>
    In the terminology of distributed applications, messages have the following characteristics:
    - A message contains raw data, produced by one component, that will be consumed by another component.
    - A message contains the data itself, not just a reference to that data.
    - The sending component expects the message content to be processed in a certain way by the destination component. The integrity of the overall system may depend on both sender and receiver doing a specific job.
    <br/>
    
    **What is an Event?**<br/>
    Events are lighter weight than messages, and are most often used for broadcast communications. The components sending the event are known as publishers, and receivers are known as subscribers.<br/>
    With events, receiving components will generally decide in which communications they are interested, and will "subscribe" to those events. The subscription is managed by an intermediary, like Azure Event Grid or Azure Event Hubs. When publishers send an event, the intermediary will route that event to interested subscribers. This pattern is known as a "publish-subscribe architecture." It's not the only way to deal with events, but it is the most common.<br/>
     <br/>
    Events have the following characteristics:
    - An event is a lightweight notification that indicates that something happened.
    - The event may be sent to multi**ple receivers, or to none at all.
    - Events are often intended to "fan out," or have a large number of subscribers for each publisher.
    - The publisher of the event has no expectation about the action a receiving component takes.
    - Some events are discrete units and unrelated to other events.
    - Some events are part of a related and ordered series. <br/> 
    <br/> 
    
    **How to choose messages or events?**<br/>
    **Events** are more likely to be used for broadcasts and are often ephemeral, meaning a communication might not be handled by any receiver if none is currently subscribing. **Messages** are more likely to be used where the distributed application requires a guarantee that the communication will be processed.<br/>
    <br/>
    For each communication, consider the following question: **Does the sending component expect the communication to be processed in a particular way by the destination component?**<br/>
    If the answer is yes, choose to use a message. If the answer is no, you may be able to use events.<br/>
    
    Azure offers two solution to message-based approach, **Azure Queue Storage** & **Azure Service Bus**<br/>
    
    **Azure Queue Storage** - Queue storage is a service that uses Azure Storage to store large numbers of messages that can be securely accessed from anywhere in the world using a simple REST-based interface. Queues can contain millions of messages, limited only by the capacity of the storage account that owns it.
    
    **Azure Service Bus Queues** - Service Bus is a message broker system intended for enterprise applications. These apps often utilize multiple communication protocols, have different data contracts, higher security requirements, and can include both cloud and on-premises services. Service Bus is built on top of a dedicated messaging infrastructure designed for exactly these scenarios.
    
    **Azure Service Bus Topics** - Azure Service Bus topics are like queues, but can have multiple subscribers. When a message is sent to a topic instead of a queue multiple components can be triggered to do their work. Internally, topics use queues. When you post to a topic, the message is copied and dropped into the queue for each subscription. The queue means that the message copy will stay around to be processed by **each subscription branch** even if the component processing that subscription is too busy to keep up.
    
    **Benefits of Queue**<br/>
    Queue infrastructures can support many advanced features that make them very useful in the following ways:
    
    - **Increased reliability**<br/>
    Queues are used by distributed applications as a temporary storage location for messages pending delivery to a destination component. The source component can add a message to the queue and destination components can retrieve the message at the front of the queue for processing. Queues increase the reliability of the message exchange because, at times of high demand, messages can simply wait until a destination component is ready to process them.
        
    - **Message delivery guarantees**<br/>
    Queuing systems usually guarantee delivery of each message in the queue to a destination component. However, these guarantees can take different approaches:
        - At-Least-Once Delivery - In this approach, each message is guaranteed to be delivered to at least one of the components that retrieve messages from the queue.<br/>
        **Note** - In certain circumstances, it is possible that the same message may be delivered more than once. For example, if there are two instances of a web app retrieving messages from a queue, ordinarily each message goes to only one of those instances. However, if one instance takes a long time to process the message, and a time-out expires, the message may be sent to the other instance as well. Your web app code should be designed with this possibility in mind.<br/>
        
        - At-Most-Once Delivery - In this approach, each message is not guaranteed to be delivered, and there is a very small chance that it may not arrive. However, unlike At-Least-Once delivery, there is no chance that the message will be delivered twice. 
        
        - First-In-First-Out (FIFO) -  In most messaging systems, messages usually leave the queue in the same order in which they were added, but you should consider whether this order is guaranteed. If your distributed application requires that messages are processed in precisely the correct order, you must choose a queue system that includes a FIFO guarantee.
        
    - **Transaction support**<br/>
    Some closely related groups of messages may cause problems when delivery fails for one message in the group.<br/>
    For example, consider an e-commerce application. When the user clicks the Buy button, a series of messages might be generated and sent off to various processing destinations:
        - A message with the order details is sent to a fulfillment center
        - A message with the total and payment details is sent to a credit card processor.
        - A message with the receipt information is sent to a database to generate an invoice for the customer<br/>
    
    In this case, we want to make sure all messages get processed, or none of them are processed. We won't be in business long if the credit card message is not delivered, and all our orders are fulfilled without payment! You can avoid these kinds of problems by grouping the two messages into a transaction. Message transactions succeed or fail as a single unit - just like in the database world.<br/>
    
    **Choose Service Bus Topics if**
    - you need multiple receivers to handle each message
    <br/>
    
    **Choose Service Bus queues if**
    - You need an At-Most-Once delivery guarantee.
    - You need a FIFO guarantee.
    - You need to group messages into transactions.
    - You want to receive messages without polling the queue.
    - You need to provide a role-based access model to the queues.
    - You need to handle messages larger than 64 KB but less than 256 KB.
    - Your queue size will not grow larger than 80 GB.
    - You would like to be able to publish and consume batches of messages.
    <br/>
    
    **Choose Queue storage if**
    - You need an audit trail of all messages that pass through the queue.
    - You expect the queue to exceed 80 GB in size.
    - You want to track progress for processing a message inside of the queue.
    <br/>
    
    **What is Azure Event Grid?**<br/>
    Azure Event Grid is a fully-managed event routing service running on top of Azure Service Fabric. Event Grid distributes events from different sources, such as Azure Blob storage accounts or Azure Media Services, to different handlers, such as Azure Functions or Webhooks. Event Grid was created to make it easier to build event-based and serverless applications on Azure.<br/>
    Event Grid supports most Azure services as a publisher or subscriber and can be used with third-party services. It provides a dynamically scalable, low-cost, messaging system that allows publishers to notify subscribers about a status change. The following illustration shows Azure Event Grid receiving messages from multiple sources and distributing them to event handlers based on subscription.<br/>
    
    There are several concepts in Azure Event Grid that connect a source to a subscriber:
    - **Events**: What happened.
    - **Event sources**: Where the event took place.
    - **Topics**: The endpoint where publishers send events.
    - **Event subscriptions**: The endpoint or built-in mechanism to route events, sometimes to multiple handlers. Subscriptions are also used by handlers to filter incoming events intelligently.
    - **Event handlers**: The app or service reacting to the event.
    
    The following illustration shows an Azure Event Grid positioned between multiple event sources and multiple event handlers. The event sources send events to the Event Grid and the Event Grid forwards relevant events to the subscribers. Event Grid use topics to decide which events to send to which handlers. Events sources tag each event with one or more topics, and event handlers subscribe to the topics they are interested in.
    <br/>

    **What is an event?**<br/>
    Events are the data messages passing through Event Grid that describe what has taken place. Each event is self-contained, can be up to 64 KB, and contains several pieces of information based on a schema defined by Event Grid:
    
    ```json
    [
      {
        "topic": string,
        "subject": string,
        "id": string,
        "eventType": string,
        "eventTime": string,
        "data":{
          object-unique-to-each-publisher
        },
        "dataVersion": string,
        "metadataVersion": string
      }
    ]
    ```
    
    |Field|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |topic|The full resource path to the event source. Event Grid provides this value.|
    |subject|Publisher-defined path to the event subject.|
    |id|The unique identifier for event.|
    |eventType|One of the registered event types for this event source. This is a value you can create filters against, e.g. CustomerCreated, BlobDeleted, HttpRequestReceived, etc.|
    |eventTime|The time the event was generated based on the provider's UTC time.|
    |data|Specific information that is relevant to the type of event. For example, an event about a new file being created in Azure Storage has details about the file, such as the lastTimeModified value. Or, an Event Hubs event has the URL of the Capture file. This field is optional.|
    |dataVersion|The schema version of the data object. The publisher defines the schema version.|
    |metadataVersion|The schema version of the event metadata. Event Grid defines the schema of the top-level properties. Event Grid provides this value.|
    
    **What is an event source?**<br/>
    Event sources are responsible for sending events to Event Grid. Each event source is related to one or more event types. For example, Azure Storage is the event source for blob created events. IoT Hub is the event source for device created events. Your application is the event source for custom events that you define.
    
    **Types of event sources**
    Events can be generated by the following Azure resource types:
    - **Azure Subscriptions and Resource Groups**: Subscriptions and resource groups generate events related to management operations in Azure. For example, when a user creates a virtual machine, this source generates an event.
    - **Container registry**: The Azure Container Registry service generates events when images in the registry are added, removed, or changed.
    - **Event Hub**: Event Hub can be used to process and store events from a variety of data sources - typically logging or telemetry related. Event Hub can generate events to Event Grid when files are captured.
    - **Service Bus**: Service bus can generate events to Event Grid when there are active messages with no active listeners.
    - **Storage accounts**: Storage accounts can generate events when users add blobs, files, table entries, or queue messages. You can use both blob accounts and General-purpose V2 accounts as event sources.
    - **Media Services**: Media Services hosts video and audio media and provides advanced management features for media files. Media Services can generate events when an encoding job is started or completed on a video file.
    - **Azure IoT Hub**: IoT Hub communicates with and gathers telemetry from IoT devices. It can generate events whenever such communications arrive.
    - **Custom events**: Custom events can be generated using the REST API, or with the Azure SDK on Java, GO, .NET, Node, Python, and Ruby. For example, you could create a custom event in the Web Apps feature of Azure App Service. This can happen in the worker role when it picks up a message from a storage queue.
    
    **What is an event topic?**<br/>
    Event topics categorize events into groups. Topics are represented by a public endpoint and are where the event source sends events to. When designing your application, you can decide how many topics to create. Larger solutions will create a custom topic for each category of related events, while smaller solutions might send all events to a single topic.
    
    Topics are divided into system topics, and custom topics.
    - **System topics** are built-in topics provided by Azure services. You don't see system topics in your Azure subscription because the publisher owns the topics, but you can subscribe to them. To subscribe, you provide information about the resource you want to receive events from. As long as you have access to the resource, you can subscribe to its events.
    - Custom topics are application and third-party topics. When you create or are assigned access to a custom topic, you see that custom topic in your subscription.
    
    **What is an event subscription?**<br/>
    Event Subscriptions define which events on a topic an event handler wants to receive. A subscription can also filter events by their type or subject, so you can ensure an event handler only receives relevant events.
    
    **What is an event handler?**<br/>
    An event handler (sometimes referred to as an event "subscriber") is any component (application or resource) that can receive events from Event Grid. For example, Azure Functions can execute code in response to the new song being added to the Blob storage account. Subscribers can decide which events they want to handle and Event Grid will efficiently notify each interested subscriber when a new event is available - no polling required.
    
    **Types of event handlers**
    The following object types in Azure can receive and handle events from Event Grid:
    - **Azure Functions**: Custom code that runs in Azure, without the need for explicit configuration of a host virtual server or container. Use an Azure function as an event handler when you want to code a custom response to the event.
    - **Webhooks**: A webhook is a web API that implements a push architecture.
    - **Azure Logic Apps**: An Azure logic app hosts a business process as a workflow.
    - **Microsoft Flow**: Flow also hosts workflows, but it is easier for non-technical staff to use.
    
    **Should you use Event Grid?**
    Use Event Grid when you need these features:
    - **Simplicity**: It is straightforward to connect sources to subscribers in Event Grid.
    - **Advanced filtering**: Subscriptions have close control over the events they receive from a topic.
    - **Fan-out**: You can subscribe to an unlimited number of endpoints to the same events and topics.
    - **Reliability**: Event Grid retries event delivery for up to 24 hours for each subscription.
    - **Pay-per-event**: Pay only for the number of events that you transmit.
    
    Event Grid is a simple but versatile event distribution system. Use it to deliver discrete events to subscribers, which will receive those events reliably and quickly. We have one more messaging model to examine - what if we want to deliver a large stream of events? In this scenario, Event Grid isn't a great solution because it's designed for one-event-at-a-time delivery. Instead, we need to turn to another Azure service: Event Hubs.
