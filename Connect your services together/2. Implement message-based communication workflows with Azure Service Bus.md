    **Creating a Queue in Service Bus**<br/>
    - **Message time to live** - Message time to live determines how long a message will stay in the queue before it expires and is removed or dead lettered. When sending messages it is possible to specify a different time to live for only that message. This default will be used for all messages in the queue which do not specify a time to live for themselves.
    - **Locked duration** - Sets the amount of time that a message is locked for other receivers. After its lock expires, a message pulled by one receiver becomes available to be pulled by other receivers. Defaults to 30 seconds, with a maximum of 5 minutes.
    - **Enable duplicate detection** - Enabling duplicate detection configures your queue to keep a history of all messages sent to the queue for a configurable amount of time. During that interval, your queue will not accept any duplicate messages. Enabling this property guarantees exactly-once delivery over a user-defined span of time.
    - **Enable dead lettering on message expiration** - Dead lettering messages involves holding messages that cannot be successfully delivered to any receiver to a separate queue after they have expired. Messages do not expire in the dead letter queue, and it supports peek-lock delivery and all transactional operations.
    - **Enable sessions** - Service bus sessions allow ordered handling of unbounded sequences of related messages. With sessions enabled a queue can guarantee first-in-first-out delivery of messages.
     **Enable partitioning** - Partitions a queue across multiple message brokers and message stores. Disconnects the overall throughput of a partitioned entity from any single message broker or messaging store. This property is not modifiable after a queue has been created.

     **The Microsoft.Azure.ServiceBus NuGet package**<br/>
     To make it easy to write code that sends and receives messages through Service Bus, Microsoft provides a library of .NET classes, which you can use in any .NET Framework language to interact with a Service Bus queue, topic, or relay. You can include this library in your application by adding the Microsoft.Azure.ServiceBus NuGet package.<br/>
     The most important class in this library for queues is the QueueClient class. You must start by instantiating this class both in sending and receiving components.
