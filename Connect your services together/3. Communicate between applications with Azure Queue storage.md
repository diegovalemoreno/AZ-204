    **Access authorization**<br/>
    Every request to a queue must be authorized and there are several options to choose from.
    |Authorization Type|Description|
    |Azure Active Directory|You can use role-based authentication and identify specific clients based on AAD credentials.|
    |Shared Key|Sometimes referred to as an account key, this is an encrypted key signature associated with the storage account. Every storage account has two of these keys that can be passed with each request to authenticate access. Using this approach is like using a root password - it provides full access to the storage account.|
    |Shared access signature|A shared access signature (SAS) is a generated URI that grants limited access to objects in your storage account to clients. You can restrict access to specific resources, permissions, and scope to a data range to automatically turn off access after a period of time.|

    **Programatically accessing a queue**<br/>

    Notice that get and delete are separate operations. This arrangement handles potential failures in the receiver and implements a concept called at-least-once delivery. After the receiver gets a message, that message remains in the queue but is invisible for 30 seconds. If the receiver crashes or experiences a power failure during processing, then it will never delete the message from the queue. After 30 seconds, the message will reappear in the queue and another instance of the receiver can process it to completion.<br/>
    
    **The Azure Storage Client Library for .NET**<br/>
    The Azure Storage Client Library for .NET provides types to represent each of the objects you need to interact with:
    - **CloudStorageAccount** represents your Azure storage account.
    - **CloudQueueClient** represents Azure Queue storage.
    - **CloudQueue** represents one of your queue instances.
    - **CloudQueueMessage** represents a message.
