1. [Choose the best Azure service to automate your business processes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/choose-azure-service-to-integrate-and-automate-business-processes/)

    Business processes modeled in software are often called **workflows**. Azure includes four different technologies that you can use to build and implement workflows that integrate multiple systems
    * Logic Apps
    * Microsoft Power Automate
    * WebJobs
    * Azure Functions
    
    These four technologies have the following similarities
    * Accept Inputs
    * Run Actions
    * Include Condition
    * Produce Output
    * Triggered on a schedule or other external events
    
    **Design-First Approach**<br/>
    It includes user interface in which you can design the workflow and includes the following technologies:
    * **Logic Apps**<br/>
        A service that you can use to automate, orchestrate and integrate disparate components of a distributed application. You can use Logic Apps Designer to define the workflow. Alternatively, you may prefer to code the workflow in JSON notations using the code-view.</br>
        A connector is a Logic Apps component that provides an interface to an external service. Logic Apps provides hundreds of pre-built connectors that you can use to create your apps. If you have an unusual or unique system that you want to call from a Logic Apps, you can create your own connector if your system exposes a REST API.
        
    * **Microsoft Power Automate**<br/>
        A service that you can use to create workflows even when you have no IT Pro experience. You can create workflows that integrate and orchestrate many different components by using the web or mobile app.</br>
        Under the hood, Microsoft Power Automate is built on Logic Apps. This fact means that Power Automate supports the same range of connectors and actions. You can also use custom connectors in Microsoft Power Automate.
    
    **Design-First technologies compared**
    |               | Microsoft Power Automate | Logic Apps |
    | ------------- | ------------------------ | ---------- |
    | Intended users  | Office workers and business analysts | Developers and IT pros |
    | Intended scenarios  | GUI only. Browser and mobile app | Browser and Visual Studio designer. Code editing is possible |
    | Application Lifecycle Management | Power Automate includes testing and production environments | Logic Apps source code can be included in Azure DevOps and source code management systems |
    
    **Code-First Approach**<br/>
    When you need more control over the performance of your workflow or need to write custom code as part of your business process, the following technologies would help:
    * **Azure WebJobs**<br/>
        WebJobs are a part of the Azure App Service that you can use to run a program or script automatically. The two kinds are:
        * Continous</b>
        * Triggered</b>
        
        You can create a Webjob by using Shell Scripts (Windows, Powershell, Bash) or by writing a program in PHP, Python, Node.js, or Java. You can also program a WebJob by using the .NET Framework or the .NET Core Framework and a .NET language such as C# or VB.NET.<br/>
        Along with C# .NET you can use the WebJobs SDK which includes a range of classes, such as JobHostConfiguration and HostBuilder, which reduce the amount of code required to interact with the Azure App Service.</b>
        
    * **Azure Functions**</b>
        An Azure Function is a simple way for you to run small pieces of code in the cloud, without having to worry about the infrastructure required to host that code. You can write the Function in C#, Java, JavaScript, PowerShell, Python, or any of the languages that are listed in the [Supported languages in Azure Functions article](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/supported-languages). In addition, with the consumption plan option, you only pay for the time when the code runs. Azure automatically scales your function in response to the demand from users.<br/>
        
        Following is the list of function triggers:
        * HTTPTrigger
        * TimerTrigger
        * BlobTrigger
        * CosmosDBTrigger
        
        Azure Functions can integrate with many different services both within Azure and from third parties. These services can trigger your function, or send data input to your function, or receive data output from your function.
        
    **Code-First technologies compared**
    
    In most cases, the simple administration and more flexible coding model provided by Azure Functions may lead you to choose them in preference to WebJobs. However, you may choose WebJobs for the following reasons:
    * You want the code to be a part of an existing App Service application and to be managed as part of that application, for example in the same Azure DevOps environment.
    * You need close control over the object that listens for events that trigger the code. This object in question is the JobHost class, and you have more flexibility to modify its behavior in WebJobs.

    |               | Azure WebJobs | Azure Functions |
    | ------------- | ------------- | --------------- |
    | Supported languages | C# if you are using the WebJobs SDK | C#, Java, JavaScript, PowerShell, etc. |
    | Automatic scaling | No | Yes |
    | Development and testing in a browser | No | Yes |
    | Pay-per-use pricing | No | Yes |
    | Integration with Logic Apps | No | Yes |
    | Package managers | NuGet if you are using the WebJobs SDK | Nuget and NPM |
    | Can be part of an App Service application | Yes | No |
    | Provides close control of JobHost | Yes | No |
