3. [Execute an Azure Function with triggers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/execute-azure-function-with-triggers/)

    **What is a trigger?** - [Refer 2. Create serverless logic with Azure Functions](2.%20Create%20serverless%20logic%20with%20Azure%20Functions.md)
    
     **What is a binding?** - [Refer 2. Create serverless logic with Azure Functions](2.%20Create%20serverless%20logic%20with%20Azure%20Functions.md)
    
    **What is a CRON expression?** 
    A CRON expression is a string that consists of six fields that represent a set of times.<br/>
    The order of the six fields in Azure is: {second} {minute} {hour} {day} {month} {day of the week}.<br/>
    For example, a CRON expression to create a trigger that executes every five minutes looks like: __0 */5 * * * *__ <br/>
    
    **Special characters in CRON expression**
    |Special Character|Meaning|Example|
    |-----------------|-------|-------|
    |\*\*|Selects every value in a field|An asterisk "\*" in the day of the week field means every day.|
    |,|Separates items in a list|A comma "1,3" in the day of the week field means just Mondays (day 1) and Wednesdays (day 3).|
    |-|Specifies a range|A hyphen "10-12" in the hour field means a range that includes the hours 10, 11, and 12.|
    |/|Specifies an increment|A slash "\*/10" in the minutes field means an increment of every 10 minutes.|

    **What is an HTTP trigger Authorization level?** - An HTTP trigger Authorization level is a flag that indicates if an incoming HTTP request needs an API key for authentication reasons.<br/>
    
    There are three Authorization levels:
    - Function
    - Anonymous
    - Admin
    <br/>
    The **Function** and **Admin** levels are "key" based. There are two types of keys: function and host. Function keys are specific to a function. Host keys apply to all functions inside the function app. If your Authorization level is set to **Function**, you can use either a function or a host key. If your Authorization level is set to **Admin**, you must supply a host key.<br/>
    The **Anonymous** level means that there's no authentication required.
