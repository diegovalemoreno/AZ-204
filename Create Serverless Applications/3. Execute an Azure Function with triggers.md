    **What is a CRON expression?** 
    A CRON expression is a string that consists of six fields that represent a set of times.<br/>
    The order of the six fields in Azure is: {second} {minute} {hour} {day} {month} {day of the week}.<br/>
    For example, a CRON expression to create a trigger that executes every five minutes looks like: __0 */5 * * * *__ <br/>
    
    **Special characters in CRON expression**
    |Special Character|Meaning|Example|
    |-----------------|-------|-------|
    |\*\*|Selects every value in a field|An asterisk "\*" in the day of the week field means every day.|
    |,|Separates items in a list|A comma "1,3" in the day of the week field means just Mondays (day 1) and Wednesdays (day 3).|
    |-|Specifies a range|A hyphen "10-12" in the hour field means a range that includes the hours 10, 11, and 12.|
    |/|Specifies an increment|A slash "\*/10" in the minutes field means an increment of every 10 minutes.|
