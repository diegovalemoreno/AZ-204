8. [Monitor GitHub events by using a webhook with Azure Functions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/monitor-github-events-with-a-function-triggered-by-a-webhook/)

    **Webhooks** are user-defined HTTP callbacks. They offer a lightweight mechanism for apps to be notified by another service when something of interest happens via an HTTP endpoint. You can use a webhook to trigger an Azure function, and then analyze the message, to determine what happened and how to respond.
