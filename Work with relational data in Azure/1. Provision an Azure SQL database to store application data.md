    **Why choose Azure SQL Database?**<br/>
    - **Convenience**<br/>
    Setting up SQL Server on a VM or on physical hardware requires you to know about hardware and software requirements. You'll need to understand the latest security best practices and manage operating system and SQL Server patches on a routine basis. You also need to manage backup and data retention issues yourself.<br/>
    With Azure SQL Database, we manage the hardware, software updates, and OS patches for you. All you specify is the name of your database and a few options. You'll have a running SQL database in minutes.
  
    - **Cost**<br/>
    Because we manage things for you, there are no systems for you to buy, provide power for, or otherwise maintain.<br/>
    Azure SQL Database has several pricing options. These pricing options enable you to balance performance versus cost. You can start for just a few dollars a month.
    
    - **Scale**<br/>
    With Azure SQL Database, you can adjust the performance and size of your database on the fly when your needs change.
    
    - **Security**
    Azure SQL Database comes with a firewall that's automatically configured to restrict connections from the Internet.<br/>
    You can allow access to specific IP addresses that you trust. Doing so allows you to use Visual Studio, SQL Server Management Studio, or other tools to manage your Azure SQL database.<br/>
