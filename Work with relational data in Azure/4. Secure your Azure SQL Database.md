4. [Secure your Azure SQL Database](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/secure-your-azure-sql-database/)
    
    **Firewall rules**<br/>
    Azure SQL Database has a built-in firewall that is used to allow and deny network access to both the database server itself, as well as individual databases. Initially, all public access to your Azure SQL Database is blocked by the SQL Database firewall.<br/>
    Firewall rules are configured at the server and/or database level, and will specifically state which network resources are allowed to establish a connection to the database. Depending on the level, the rules you can apply will be as follows:
    - Server-level firewall rules
        - Allow access to Azure services - allows services within Azure to connect to your Azure SQL Database. When enabled, this setting allows communications from all Azure public IP addresses. This includes all Azure Platform as a Service (PaaS) services, such as Azure App Service and Azure Container Service, as well as Azure VMs that have outbound Internet access. This rule can be configured through the ON/OFF option in the firewall pane in the portal, or by an IP rule that has 0.0.0.0 as the start and end IP addresses.<br/>
        This rule is used when you have applications running on PaaS services in Azure, such as Azure Logic Apps or Azure Functions, that need to access your Azure SQL Database. Many of these services don't have a static IP address, so this rule is needed to ensure they are able to connect to the database.<br/>
        ![](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/learn/modules/secure-your-azure-sql-database/media/2-allow-azure-services.png)<br/>
        - IP address rules - are rules that are based on specific public IP address ranges. IP addresses connecting from an allowed public IP range will be permitted to connect to the database.<br/>
        ![](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/learn/modules/secure-your-azure-sql-database/media/2-server-ip-rule-1.png)<br/>
        - Virtual network rules - allow you to explicitly allow connection from specified subnets inside one or more Azure virtual networks (VNets). Virtual network rules can provide greater access control to your databases and can be a preferred option depending on your scenario. Since Azure VNet address spaces are private, you can effectively eliminate exposure to public IP addresses and secure connectivity to those addresses you control.<br/>
        ![](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/learn/modules/secure-your-azure-sql-database/media/2-vnet-rule.png)<br/>
    - Database-level firewall rules
        - IP address rules - These rules allow access to an individual database on a logical server and are stored in the database itself. For database-level rules, only IP address rules can be configured. They function the same as when applied at the server-level, but are scoped to the database only.
        ![](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/learn/modules/secure-your-azure-sql-database/media/2-db-ip-rule-1.png)<br/>
        The benefits of database-level rules are their portability. When replicating a database to another server, the database-level rules will be replicated, since they are stored in the database itself.<br/>
        The downside to database-level rules is that you can only use IP address rules. This may limit the flexibility you have and can increase administrative overhead.
        
    [**Exercise - Restrict network access**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/learn/modules/secure-your-azure-sql-database/2-restrict-network-access)
    
    
    **TLS network encryption**<br/>
    Azure SQL Database enforces Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption at all times for all connections, which ensures all data is encrypted "in transit" between the database and the client.
    
    **Transparent data encryption**<br/>
    Azure SQL Database protects your data at rest using transparent data encryption (TDE). TDE performs real-time encryption and decryption of the database, associated backups, and transaction log files at rest without requiring changes to the application. Using a database encryption key, transparent data encryption performs real-time I/O encryption and decryption of the data at the page level. Each page is decrypted when it's read into memory and then encrypted before being written to disk.<br/>
    By default, TDE is enabled for all newly deployed Azure SQL databases. It's important to check that data encryption hasn’t been turned off, and older Azure SQL Server databases may not have TDE enabled.
    
    **Dynamic data masking**<br/>
    Dynamic data masking is a policy-based security feature that hides the sensitive data in the result set of a query over designated database fields, while the data in the database is not changed.<br/>
    Data masking rules consist of the column to apply the mask to, and how the data should be masked. You can create your own masking format, or use one of the standard masks such as:<br/>
    Default value, which displays the default value for that data type instead.
    - Credit card value, which only shows the last four digits of the number, converting all other numbers to lower case x’s.
    - Email, which hides the domain name and all but the first character of the email account name.
    - Number, which specifies a random number between a range of values. For example, on the credit card expiry month and year, you could select random months from 1 to 12 and set the year range from 2018 to 3000.
    - Custom string, which allows you to set the number of characters exposed from the start of the data, the number of characters exposed from the end of the data, and the characters to repeat for the remainder of the data.
    
    When querying the columns, database administrators will still see the original values, but non-administrators will see the masked values. You can allow other users to see the non-masked versions by adding them to the SQL users excluded from masking list.

    **Azure SQL Database auditing**<br/>
    By enabling auditing, operations that occur on the database are stored for later inspection or to have automated tools analyze them. Auditing is also used for compliance management or understanding how your database is used. Auditing is also required if you wish to use Azure threat detection on your Azure SQL database.<br/>
    You can use SQL database auditing to:
    - Retain an audit trail of selected events. You can define categories of database actions to be audited.
    - Report on database activity. You can use pre-configured reports and a dashboard to get started quickly with activity and event reporting.
    - Analyze reports. You can find suspicious events, unusual activity, and trends.
    - Audit logs are written to Append Blobs in an Azure Blob storage account that you designate. Audit policies can be applied at the server-level or database-level. Once enabled, you can use the Azure portal to view the logs, or send them to Log Analytics or Event Hub for further processing and analysis.
    
    **Auditing in practice**<br/>
    As a best practice, avoid enabling both server blob auditing and database blob auditing together, unless:
    - You want to use a different storage account or retention period for a specific database.
    - You want to audit event types or categories for a specific database that differs from the rest of the databases on the server. For example, you might have table inserts that need to be audited but only for a specific database.
    
    Otherwise, it's recommended you enable only server-level blob auditing and leave the database-level auditing disabled for all databases.
    
    **Advanced Data Security for Azure SQL Database**<br/>
    Advanced Data Security (ADS) provides a set of advanced SQL security capabilities, including data discovery & classification, vulnerability assessment, and Advanced Threat Protection.
    - **Data discovery & classification** (currently in preview) provides capabilities built into Azure SQL Database for discovering, classifying, labeling & protecting the sensitive data in your databases. It can be used to provide visibility into your database classification state, and to track the access to sensitive data within the database and beyond its borders.<br/>
    ![](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/learn/modules/secure-your-azure-sql-database/media/5-data-discovery-and-classification.png)<br/>
    - **Vulnerability assessment** is an easy to configure service that can discover, track, and help you remediate potential database vulnerabilities. It provides visibility into your security state, and includes actionable steps to resolve security issues, and enhance your database fortifications.<br/>
    ![](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/learn/modules/secure-your-azure-sql-database/media/5-vulnerability-assessment-dashboard.png)<br/>
    - **Advanced Threat Protection** detects anomalous activities indicating unusual and potentially harmful attempts to access or exploit your database. It continuously monitors your database for suspicious activities, and provides immediate security alerts on potential vulnerabilities, SQL injection attacks, and anomalous database access patterns. Advanced Threat Protection alerts provide details of the suspicious activity and recommend action on how to investigate and mitigate the threat.<br/>
